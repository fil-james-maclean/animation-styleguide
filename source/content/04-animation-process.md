## Ascetics of the Types of animation

1. UI Framework animations

More Utilitarian than Opulent
More Precise than playful
Easing should be heavy, slow to start and end
Bounce and spring should be subtle if present


2. UI flourish animations

What they look like
Don't demand attention
Not essential to the core work flows
Noticed subconsciously or after repeated use
Elegant and smooth


3. Editorial animations

What they look like
Progressive
Push the boundaries of the established style without departing entirely
Clear
The underlying information or message must remain paramount
Expressive
Slower more nuanced
