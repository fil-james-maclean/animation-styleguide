## Ascetics of the Types of animation

1. UI Framework animations

More Utilitarian than Opulent
More Precise than playful
Easing should be heavy, slow to start and end
Bounce and spring should be subtle if present


2. UI flourish animations

What they look like
Don't demand attention
Not essential to the core work flows
Noticed subconsciously or after repeated use
Elegant and smooth


3. Editorial animations

What they look like
Progressive
Push the boundaries of the established style without departing entirely
Clear
The underlying information or message must remain paramount
Expressive
Slower more nuanced



Design Process
Concept
Any tool that allows the idea to be accurately communicated (after effects, flash, WYSIWYG prototyping tools)
Prototype
Coded to run in the browser
Accessibility review
Sensible fall-back in place (text descriptions, raw data table)
Aim to include as many people in the experience
Test
Conduct usability testing to validate the design
Optimise
Efficient and high performance code
Smooth animations (aim for 60fps+)
Release and Measure
Consider the potential impact and set-up tracking around the animation for release
Review
Review the impact of the animation at a set date
