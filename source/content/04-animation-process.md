## Animating the Fidelity brand

*From the FIL digital brand page:*
> ### What do we want people to think about us?
> - We light the way, but donâ€™t point the way
> - We are approachable, but not casual
> - We share our knowledge, without being confusing
> - We are honest, but not blunt
> - We are professional, but not boring


*The things we want people to think about us are expressed through the choice of easings and timings.*

## Ascetics of the Types of animation
*The types of animation we have also carrie specific guidelines to deliver the brand*

### UI Framework animations
- More Utilitarian than Opulent
- More Precise than playful
- Easing should be heavy, slow to start and end
- Bounce and spring are subtle, only enough to suggest a real weight


### UI flourish animations
- Don't demand attention
- Not essential to the core work flows
- Noticed subconsciously or after repeated use
- Elegant and smooth


### Editorial animations
- Progressive
- Push the boundaries of the established style without departing entirely
- Clear
- The underlying information or message must remain paramount
- Expressive
- Slower more nuanced



## Design Process

### Concept
Any tool that allows the idea to be accurately communicated (after effects, flash, WYSIWYG prototyping tools)

### Prototype
Coded to run in the browser

### Accessibility review
Sensible fall-back in place (text descriptions, raw data table)
Aim to include as many people in the experience

### Test
Conduct usability testing to validate the design

### Optimise
Efficient and high performance code
Smooth animations (aim for 60fps+)

### Release and Measure
Consider the potential impact and set-up tracking around the animation for release

### Review
Review the impact of the animation at a set date
