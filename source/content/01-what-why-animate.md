## What do we mean by "Animation"?
User Interface (UI) animations happen on screen and are part of a digital product. They can make an interface easier to understand and use and also leave a positive impression at a subconscious level. When misused users can feel confused or put off.

UI animation is different from traditional animation that tells a story. Although some of the rules still apply, the process and objectives for making a cartoon are different from designing interface animations.


## Guiding principles for UI animations

Add value
   *They should not be included without a benefit to the user*

Don't animate for the sake of it.
   *Animation dose not automatically add value, it wont make up for an awkward user journey or inappropriate content.*

Less is More
   *Animations are to be used sparingly and should mostly go unnoticed by the end user. The more animation is used the less emphasis it carries.*

Be modest
   *It's tempting to place an animation front and center or embellish it to reflect the effort that went into it. At best this looks 'boastful' and at worst can leave users confused as to the level of significance an animation has.*





## Types of animation
1. UI Framework animations
*Utilitarian animations that show just enough to achieve the desired effect*

2. UI flourish animations
*Extra detail that raises the bar*

3. Editorial animations
*Big set pieces of interactive content*
