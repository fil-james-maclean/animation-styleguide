High level approach and philosophy for animation  “What do we animate and why?”

## Guiding principles

Add value
   *They should not be included without a benefit to the user*

Don't animate for the sake of it.
   *Animation dose not automatically add value, it wont make up for an awkward user journey or inappropriate content.*

Less is More
   *Animations are to be used sparingly and should mostly go unnoticed by the end user*

The interface is not a portfolio
   *Even if a lot of time was spend crafting an animation that doesn't mean users should know about it.*
