what animation does for the user



Respect the user's time
   *Animations should be a quick as they can be*
Under the user's control
   *They should be triggered by user input not happen on their own*



## Types of animation
1. UI Framework animations
2. UI flourish animations
3. Editorial animations


### UI framework animations
*Utilitarian animations that show just enough to achieve the desired effect*

#### What they do

Provide feedback
- Reinforce significant actions (e.g. Deal)
- Confirm the users inputs and choices (e.g. Delete)

Show the user what will happen (feedfoward)
- Highlight significant actions
- Preview the outcome of an action

Guide the user
- Draw attention to the "Next" action
- Reinforce navigational metaphors
- Reinforce "layering" metaphors


### UI Flourish animations
*Extra detail that raises the bar*

#### What they do

Push the product from Good to Outstanding
- Portray attention to detail and craftsmanship

Allude to advanced features
- Accelerators unseen by the novice user that speed up the interaction for the expert user


### Editorial animations
*Big set pieces of interactive content*

#### What they do

Engage the user
- Offer the chance to explore data and information

Help portray complex information and concepts
- Do what static content can't


## Things to avoid

Large and fast motion
The larger the object the slower it should move

Throwing UI at the user
Rapidly increasing the sale of something can give the effect of acceleration towards the user, which can make some uncomfortable or even sick.
