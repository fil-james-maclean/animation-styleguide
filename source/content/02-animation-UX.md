## What animation does for the user

Animation can make products easier to understand and use. It can also evoke certain feelings and change perceptions of a product.

When animation is included as part of the design process there is more opportunity to make innovative interaction patterns.


## Types of animation
1. UI Framework animations
2. UI flourish animations
3. Editorial animations


### UI framework animations
*Utilitarian animations that show just enough to achieve the desired effect*

#### What they do

Provide feedback
- Reinforce significant actions (e.g. Deal)
- Confirm the users inputs and choices (e.g. Delete)

Show the user what will happen (feedfoward)
- Highlight significant actions
- Preview the outcome of an action

Guide the user
- Draw attention to the "Next" action
- Reinforce navigational metaphors
- Reinforce "layering" metaphors
