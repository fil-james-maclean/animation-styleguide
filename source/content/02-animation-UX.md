## What animation does for the user

Animation can make products easier to understand and use. It can also evoke certain feelings and change perceptions of a product.

When animation is included as part of the design process there is more opportunity to make innovative interaction patterns.


## Types of animation
These categories of animation guide how design decisions are made. They also define the process for making them.

1. UI Framework animations
*Utilitarian animations that show just enough to achieve the desired effect*

2. UI flourish animations
*Extra detail that raises the bar*

3. Editorial animations
*Big set pieces of interactive content*
